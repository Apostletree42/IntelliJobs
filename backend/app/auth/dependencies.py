# AUTH RELATED DEPENDENCIES (in this file, you write functions which access entities or resources outside the module. 
# For ex: db interaction to store new user, etc)

# more ideas: create access token, get current user, check if current user is admin, etc.

# basically functions which are not core to the module, but still needed

# TAKE THIS FILE LYT IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT TO PUT HERE
