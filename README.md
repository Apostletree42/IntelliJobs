## IntelliJobs: Automating Job Portal Analysis with Large Language Models

### Overview

IntelliJobs is an innovative job recommendation system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide valuable insights to job seekers and employers. This project focuses on analyzing job descriptions from various job portals to extract key information such as highest salary, job title, location, company ratings, company size, employment type, and other essential details. By using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system delivers personalized job recommendations based on user-defined criteria.

### Features

- **Job Analysis:** Extract and analyze critical information from job descriptions, including salary, job title, location, company ratings, company size, and employment type.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive user interface (UI) where users can input their criteria (e.g., location, job title, skills) and receive tailored job recommendations.
- **RAG-based Recommendation System:** Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the recommendation system by combining retrieval-based and generation-based methods.
